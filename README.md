This project is an Employee Rating System designed for internal company use to facilitate performance reviews and feedback. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to navigate through a list of employees and assign ratings to each individual based on their performance. Each employee is linked to a company, and the system dynamically calculates the average rating for the company based on individual employee scores.

Key Features:

Employee Profiles: Users can view and rate individual employee profiles on a scale from 1 to 10.
Dynamic Averages: The application calculates and updates the company's average rating automatically as employee ratings are modified.
Security: Role-based access control can be implemented to restrict functionalities according to user roles (e.g., HR, Manager).
Validation: Ensures that all employee ratings are within the acceptable range.
Reporting: Capability to generate reports for analyzing trends and identifying performance metrics.
This project aims to streamline the employee review process, making it more structured and data-driven.
